# Puzznic

The legend of 8-bit video games era is finally on the web. Game Boy fans should be happy (huh?). Play online without installing flash players, applets, and another stinky crap. The application's build size is under 50 kB, so feel free to run it on any microwave owen with the internet access.

## Description

Finally it is here! The puzzle game to top all puzzle games. 144 levels of frustration and excitement - that's Taito's latest coin-op hit, Puzznic! A game of fiendish perplexity and diabolical puzzles, Puzznic is set to take the world by storm! Just position the blocks and make them disappear. Sounds easy? Puzznic is a one-player game that is simple in execution and yet amazingly difficult to master. Addictive gameplay as you have never imagined! Get puzzled by Puzznic and be prepared for many long nights of frustration and excitement!

## Controls

Use *arrow keys* to point on a block, then `Shift` to "grab" it, and, at last, *left* or *right* arrow key -- to move it. As easy as pie.

To turn blocks icons mode on or off, press `Space`. This mode is on by default, and it's more twisted, as every single time you start playing the game, icons are set for blocks randomly.

`R` -- restart current level

`Q` -- return to the main menu
